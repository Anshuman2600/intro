# Introduction to PyQt5, Git and GitHub

This is a project to get introduced with building GUI Application with Python using PyQt5 package.
In further addition, I also get introduced to push my personal projects on GitHub and understanding the basics of Git.


Made my first GUI application using python library PyQt5 and built-in library: sys.
      
      1. Used QApplication, QMainWindow, and QLabel from PyQt5.QtWidgets
      
      2. For working with icon I used QIcon from ***PyQt5.QtGui***

Push it to this GitHub repo from VSCode.

      1. Installed Git on my local system.

      2. Intialize repository in VSCode by giving access of my GitHub account.

      3. Added messages and commit changes.

      4. Publish the repo as Anshuman2600/intro

# Following GIF shows how to run the code

    Just open your VSCode and run it.
